# User Story
* We wanted to give users a chance to interact with others through their favorite books. With this interaction, it allows users to give their thoughts on books, and have conversations with other book lovers no matter where they are. 

# Technologies Used
* Bcrypt
* Connect-Session-Sequelize
* CSS
* Dotenv
* Express.js
* Express-Session
* Flatpickr (Vue.js)
* Handlebars.js
* Heroku
* JavaScript
* JawsDB
* MySql2
* Node.js 
* Sequelize

# Process
* As a team, we equally split up the work, and met in the middle. 
* One member was assigned the frontend coding, while other members were assigned the backend coding.
* Another member worked in the middle, connecting the backend, to the front end. 
* We made our site using the CRUD method. 

# Installation
* We downloaded the necessary NPM packages to assure that the code worked properly. 
* To make sure the code worked properly, we typed “server.js” in the terminal, and then made our way to the dynamically made html page

# Future Plans
* We would like to add an advanced search option with the book titles, categories, votes, and reviews
* We would like to add the option to make a book club with other users, and ultimately to have rooms available for book club members to have virtual meet-ups. 
* We would like to add the option to remove categories, and allow users to filter certain categories from their search.
* For the ‘add a book’ feature, we would like to add the option for users to add book covers for these books, and allow users to submit images of book covers
